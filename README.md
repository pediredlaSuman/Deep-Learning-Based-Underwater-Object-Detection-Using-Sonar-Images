## üß† Introduction

### üéØ Objective:
To build a robust, noise-tolerant object detection system for underwater surveillance using sonar images by integrating and comparing multiple deep learning models.

### üê† Motivation:
Underwater environments are inherently challenging due to turbidity, noise, and occlusions. Reliable object detection is critical for defense, navigation, marine research, and search-and-rescue operations.

## üìå Problem Statement

Enhance detection accuracy and robustness of underwater objects from sonar images by adapting state-of-the-art deep learning models and combining multiple sensor modalities.

---

## üîç Approach

1. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate and compare YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, and CenterNet architectures on sonar data.
2. **Adaptation**: Modify CenterNet with weighted heatmap scaling and focal loss to improve detection of small/occluded objects.
3. **Sensor Fusion**: Integrate sonar and optical images using feature-level fusion to improve accuracy in high-turbidity conditions.
4. **Evaluation**: Use standard detection metrics such as mAP, IoU, precision, recall.

## üèó Model Architectures

- **YOLOv5**: Real-time object detection with anchor boxes and spatial pyramid pooling.
- **Faster R-CNN**: Region proposal-based detector, good for high-accuracy object localization.
- **CenterNet**: Keypoint-based object detection; modified with focal loss and adaptive heatmaps.
- **Fusion Module**: Combines sonar and optical features using weighted attention mechanism.
